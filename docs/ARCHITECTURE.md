# Overview
Think of it as a virtual, AI-aware “truth layer” that sits on top of your existing sources, exposes consistent business concepts (Entities, Measures, Dimensions), and lets both humans and LLMs ask questions without caring where the data lives.
# What the USL does (in plain terms)
* Names things once: “Customer,” “MRR,” “Active User,” “Refund Rate,” etc., with definitions, owners, and tests.
* Virtualises access: Federates queries across Postgres/OLTP, warehouses, SaaS APIs—no central lake required.
* Speaks multiple dialects: SQL/GraphQL/REST for apps and BI; semantic JSON/YAML for LLMs.
* Guards and explains: Row/column security, lineage, data contracts, metric versioning, explainability.

* FastAPI service with idempotent headers (X-Idempotency-Key, X-Correlation-Id).
* CI: test matrix, Docker build, GHCR push.

# AI infusion points (the tasty bits)
* NL → Metric/DSL → SQL: Models translate user text into semantic DSL first (not raw SQL), then compile to SQL via the USL—greatly reduces hallucinations.
* RAG over the catalogue: LLM retrieves metric definitions, entities, lineage, and policies before answering.
* Guardrails: The USL validates any AI-authored query against the metric catalogue and row-level security.
* Explanations: Return “Why” alongside numbers (definition, filters, last refresh, owner).

# Minimal, pragmatic stack (fits your Postgres/Redis/Weaviate world)
* Federation/virtualisation: Trino (or Starburst). If you prefer pure virtualisation UI, Denodo.
* Semantic/metrics layer:
  - OSS: Cube (semantic schema + SQL/GraphQL), or dbt Core + MetricFlow for metrics-first.
  - Commercial: AtScale, Transform (Metrics Store), or Looker’s semantic layer if you’re already in GCP.
* Catalogue/lineage: OpenMetadata or DataHub, with OpenLineage/Marquez.
* Quality/contracts: Great Expectations (pytest for data) + schema contracts in source repos.
* Vector/RAG for docs: Weaviate (you already use it) with embeddings of metric docs + policies.
* Policy/RLS: Push down to sources when you can (Postgres RLS), otherwise enforce in Cube/Trino.
* Cache: Redis for query result caching and semantic synonym maps for NL.
# Sample artifacts (copy-paste friendly)
1) Metric definition (MetricFlow/dbt-metrics style YAML)

        yaml
          version: 1
          metrics:
            - name: mrr
              label: Monthly Recurring Revenue
              type: sum
              type_params:
                measure: revenue_amount
              filter: contract_status = 'active'
              timestamp: contract_month
              grain: month
              dims: [customer_id, plan_tier, region]
          
          entities:
            - name: customer
              identifiers:
                - name: customer_id
                  type: primary
              dims: [region, signup_date]
              measures:
                - name: revenue_amount
                  expr: amount
                  agg: sum
2) Semantic synonyms (for NL → DSL)
   
       {
        "mrr": ["monthly recurring revenue", "subscription revenue", "MRR"],
         "active_user": ["DAU", "daily active users", "active customers"],
         "region": ["geo", "market", "territory"]
       }

3) A tiny semantic DSL to keep LLMs honest

       {
           "metric": "mrr",
           "filters": [{"field":"region","op":"IN","value":["EMEA","APAC"]}],
           "time": {"grain":"month","start":"2025-01-01","end":"2025-09-30"},
           "group_by": ["plan_tier"]
       }
4) GraphQL slice (via Cube)

       type Query {
            mrr(
              region: [String!]
              plan_tier: [String!]
              from: DateTime
              to: DateTime
              granularity: TimeGranularity = MONTH
            ): [MrrPoint!]!
          }
          
          type MrrPoint {
            time: DateTime!
            plan_tier: String!
            value: Float!
            definitionUrl: String! # points to catalogue entry
          }

# How it works end-to-end (NL to number)
* User asks: “Show MRR by plan for EMEA this year.”
* LLM retrieves metric docs from Weaviate → maps words using synonyms → emits semantic DSL.
* USL validates DSL against catalogue (policy + freshness + lineage) → compiles to SQL via Cube/MetricFlow/Trino.
* Result + explain block returned:
  - metric definition version
  - filters/grain
  - data sources touched
  - owner and SLA

 # Doing this without a lake (patterns that work
* Federate, don’t centralise: Use Trino to join Postgres tables with SaaS connectors (e.g., HubSpot, Stripe) on the fly.
* Selective materialisation: Only cache hot aggregates in Postgres/ClickHouse for speed; everything else stays virtual.
* Push compute to source: Where possible, push predicates and RLS to underlying systems for cost and security.
* Contracts at the edge: Source teams publish schemas + change policies; USL treats them as APIs.

# Governance that keeps it sane
* One-line definitions + longer “source of truth” docs per metric.
* Owners & SLAs: every metric has a human owner and a freshness target.
* Versioned metrics (mrr@v1 → mrr@v2) with dep warnings.
* Lineage everywhere: column-level when possible.
* Tests: null, uniqueness, ranges, and definition conformance (filters/grain) in CI.

# Quick implementation plan
* Pick the spine: Cube (semantic + GraphQL) or dbt+MetricFlow (metrics-first) atop Trino.
* Model the top 10 metrics & 5 core entities—write YAML + owners + tests + synonyms.
* Stand up the LLM gateway: tiny service that converts NL → DSL → USL; RAG over the metric docs (Weaviate).
* Wire policy: row/column security rules; audit logs; embed lineage links in every result.
* Ship a BI and a chat demo: same metric via PowerBI/Looker and via chat—prove consistency.
* Add more connectors & materialise hot paths once you see query patterns.

# Common pitfalls (and how to dodge them)
* Letting the LLM write SQL directly: always force NL → DSL → validated compile.
* Over-modelling the universe: start with money, users, products, time; expand later.
* Shadow metrics: block ad-hoc definitions; everything funnels through the USL.
* No owners: metrics without owners decay; make ownership explicit.

# RAG: JSONL schema + examples (no private data).
* Redaction Policy
* No secrets or private endpoints.
* No business logic.
* Public artefacts are patterns + scaffolding only.
